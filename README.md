## Introduction

  This research aims to enhance the security of smart vehicles by detecting and classifying attacks that compromise their safety. The study employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, specifically VGG19 to process data from the vehicle's 
  On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) port. This data is converted into a visual format for processing. The research focuses on multi-class classification of various attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS), Spoofing (RPM Spoof, Gear Spoof), and Fuzzy Attacks.
  The ultimate goal is to develop a solution that not only boosts system security but also preserves user privacy and trust.

## Abstract

Abstract—Internet of Vehicles in brief is the distributed net-
works that makes the use of data produced due to connected cars
and vehicular ad-hoc networks. With the progress in Science and
Technology, The Internet of Vehicles has got an exponential boost,
leading to tremendous progress in the field.The smart vehicles
are equipped with various sensors which are data collection
points, from which various useful data is collected for the
processing and operating of the intelligent vehicles and play a
vital role in implementation and communication of the vehicles.
The smart vehicles has been a boon to humans which include
fewer accidents, faster travel times, less theft due to tracking. But
with these advantages, the vehicles have to cope up with various
malicious intrusions and issues that compromise with the security
and integrity of the vehicle. This is one of the major issues in
the IOV which makes the data more vulnerable to be exposed.
The research work aims to make the system more secure and
safe by the detection and classification of the attacks that make
these smart vehicles unsafe. The approach used in this work
is based on the CNN based architecture VGG19, in which the
data obtained from OBD port of vehicle and converted to visual
format is feed. The types of the attacks included in this research
work for the classification are Denial of Service Attack (DoS),
Spoofing(RPM Spoof, Gear Spoof), Fuzzy Attack. The purpose
of the research is to design a solution that makes the system
more secure, preserves the privacy and increase the trustability
of the user.
Index Terms—VANET, CNN, STP, DoS, Fuzzy, Spoofing, VGG.
